<h4>Sustainable practices - Food Consumption</h4>
<p>One way we could all help the reduction of overconsumption is through supporting local farmers. The way we produce food now is a key loss to biodiveristy across the whole planet. It also has an impact on the health of people. However, this can all change, we as a community should embrace regenerative agriculture and local food systems. Interestingly, crops that are grown locally they are harvested fresh at their peak ripeness. In order for these crops to reach our local retail stores around the globe they need to be harvested earlier so that it can be shipped off for longer period of time without going bad. Which leads to farmers having to grow varieties based on imperishability instead of flavor. </p>
<h4>Benefits of buying locally </h4>

<p>There are several benefits involving local foods. It could signifiacntly decrease in food miles (term refers to the distance that food travels to reach local supermarkets). Food miles has affected our plannet immensely due to all the high volume of greenhouse gas emission which not only has an impact on our health but also the nutritional value of the food that is internationally traded. Such as, imported foods at the supermarket often travel thousands of miles to get to the local retail stores through trucks and planes. This causes massive fuel consumption and pollution. However, purchasing local foods doesn't require any of this it involves purchasing goods that have been produced in local environment, when we purchase local food it supports our local farmers to operate their business. Alternatively, farmers would then have to sell their land which would be used for industrial or commericial use and these would release remarkably more greenhouse gas emission than farm lands, this would also have an impact on wildlife. </p>

<h4>Using Sustainable Products</h4>

<p>One of the biggest threat to our planet is palstic pollution. In 1950, the world produced more than 2 million tons of plastic per year. By 2015, this annual production rised to 419 million tons of exacerbating plastic waste. Purchasing sustainable product in a longer time frame will not only bring benefits to the environment but also save your wallet from over consumption of non recyclable material. Buying a bottle of water for $3 each day adds up to $1095 each year — so it’s not hard to see how ditching this habit could save you lots of cash. Plastic bags are frequently and hold responsibility for the extinction of sea life. Our shop sells bags for life which can not only save your wallets but also our beautiful marine life.   </p>
